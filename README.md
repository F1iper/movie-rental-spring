# :movie_camera: Movie Rental (Java/Spring)

Welcome to the Movie Rental Application, built using Spring Boot and Spring Security.

The application allows users to rent and return movies, view their rental history, and manage their account information.

The application uses Spring Boot as its foundation, providing a robust and easy-to-use framework for building web applications. 
Spring Security with JWT is used to handle authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access the various 
features of the application.

The application includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing movies and user accounts. 
Users can search for movies by title, view movie details, and rent or return movies. 
They can also view their rental history and update their account information.
